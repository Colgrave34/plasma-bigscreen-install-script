# Stella Post-Install Script
A Home Theater PC post-install script.  
Utilizes Arch and KDE Plasma Bigscreen.  
  
**This project is under construction!**  
**Do not use for production!**
  
To use this post-install script, it is assumed that you have a functional Arch Linux system logged in as a regular user with sudo privileges, and have internet connectivity and systemd installed.  
  
Please note that this post-install script merely provides the essential components for operating Plasma Bigscreen and Kodi.  
It does not eliminate the need for configuring Plasma Bigscreen, Kodi or the whole system.  
  
This post-install script is intended for people who have experience with Linux, and **I am not liable if you break your operating system**.  
To learn all the commands included in this post-install script, please visit the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).

# Q&A
## Would you support other distros? Like Fedora or Ubuntu? 
At the moment I have no plans to support other distros. Right now Plasma Bigscreen is easier to work with on Arch than other distros (AUR is the best!), but that doesn't mean I won't change my mind in the feature.
